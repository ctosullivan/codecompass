# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Initial project scaffolding (Phase 0): MIT license, Python packaging
  (setuptools, `src/depcompass/` layout, `requires-python >=3.11`),
  process-rules `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`,
  `architecture/overview.md`, nine architecture decision records
  (`decisions/0001`-`0009`), forward-looking `docs/cli-reference.md` and
  `docs/config-schema.md`, and an empty `tests/` skeleton. No CLI
  functionality is implemented yet.
- Core data models and `vendor.toml` parsing (Phase 1): `depcompass.core`
  (`VendorConfig`, `Ecosystem`, `Depth`, `DepNode`, `VendorDigest`),
  `depcompass.config` (fail-fast `vendor.toml` parsing via `tomllib`), and
  a `depcompass.cli` skeleton with all 5 planned commands registered as
  stubs. Two new ADRs (`decisions/0010`, `decisions/0011`).
- `planning/ROADMAP.md`: a full-roadmap phase-status table (all 13
  phases, MVP milestone vs post-MVP), distinct from `planning/CONTEXT.md`'s
  current-phase-only session-resumption view.
- Phase 2 plan (`planning/phase-2-ecosystem-adapters.md`): scopes the
  `EcosystemAdapter` ABC and npm/Python/Cargo adapter implementations.
  Adapter code itself is not yet implemented.

### Changed

- `CLAUDE.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` now require keeping
  `planning/ROADMAP.md` in sync: added to it when a phase's plan file is
  created, marked `done` when a phase finishes.
- **Design decision, not yet shipped**: the chat REPL (Phases 7-8) is now
  designed as a primary consumption mode for vendor digests, not a
  convenience layer. Phase 5's gap analysis will produce dual-audience
  output (technical + a conversational overview, same call/cost); Phase
  8's REPL will load a project-wide dependency rollup unconditionally at
  session start rather than routing to it. See `decisions/0012`.
