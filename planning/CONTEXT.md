## Current phase

**A planning session has redefined what "CodeCompass v1" means.** Phases
0-38 are all `done` and unchanged — they are now framed as the
**foundation** (the npm/PyPI/Cargo package-source-grounding tool). The
former "v1.0" (Phase 23 = publish that tool to PyPI) is superseded:
**all publishing is held until the redefined v1** (user decision,
2026-09-09) — CodeCompass has never been published, and the first-ever
PyPI release will be the redefined v1 as `1.0.0`. "CodeCompass v1" is
redefined as a *product-validation milestone*: CodeCompass developed
agent-led, validated against real external reference-project work
(Technical Clipper, then Ledgerkit), improved from that evidence,
generalised only as far as evidence justifies, then released after
blank-slate doc reconstruction and an independent audit.

**Phases 39 and 40 are `done` (Stage A of the redefined-v1 roadmap).**

- **39** ratified the redefinition: ADRs [`decisions/0048`](../decisions/0048-redefined-v1-is-a-product-validation-milestone.md)
  and [`decisions/0049`](../decisions/0049-agent-led-development-model.md)
  `Accepted`; `pyproject.toml` `version` → `1.0.0.dev0`; ROADMAP's Stage
  A–F section ratified; Phase 23 Part B superseded; Phases 24/25
  `deferred` (not renumbered).
- **40** made the agent-led model operational: `.claude/agents/` roster
  of 7 (`context-evaluator`, `reference-project-tester`, `docs-maintainer`,
  `roadmap-context-curator`, `knowledge-curator`, `docs-reconstructor`,
  `release-phase-auditor`); `planning/agent-led-workflow.md`; `CLAUDE.md`
  §8/§1/§5/§6 changes approved (gate G4) + applied + mirrored to
  `CONTRIBUTING.md`. Small forced fix to
  `scripts/check_user_docs.py::check_readme_phase_count` (excludes the
  redefined-v1 ROADMAP section) — candidate learning **L-001**.

**No `src/codecompass/` change in either phase; no release/tag (gate
G2-b).** The live agent smoke delegation was deferred — the roster's
first real exercise is Phase 41 (its DoD already requires a
`release-phase-auditor` pass).

**Next: Phase 41** ([`phase-41-learning-lifecycle.md`](phase-41-learning-lifecycle.md))
— make `planning/learnings/` operational, finalise the
`knowledge-curator` brief against the real files, extend
`scripts/check_user_docs.py` with learnings-hygiene checks, and triage
L-001 end-to-end (first real use of the agent-led loop). No gate blocks
it.

The `planning/v1-redefinition/` package + `planning/learnings/` scaffold +
`planning/agent-led-workflow.md` + Stage A phase plans (`phase-39`…`phase-44`)
are the governing plan for this milestone group.

Everything below this line describes the **foundation** (phases 0-38) and
remains accurate.

Phases 30-38 (doc-graph precision, user-facing docs, docs-sync tooling,
redundancy cleanup) are all `done`.
`codecompass` now: auto-clones every tracked vendor; detects real
project-source usage (vendor- and symbol-level); maps docs/skills/
dependencies/spec-docs/vendor-docs into a SQLite graph with both
mechanical and AI-enriched relationship edges, now with real `(file,
line)` code-usage traversal, typed relation labels, and heading-scoped
doc chunking sharpening both; auto-triggers disclosed, confirmable
batched AI enrichment for usage-proven vendors *and* relationships;
exposes all of it via `codecompass query`, `/discovery`, and generated
Skills; can `undo` itself cleanly; frames chat as secondary. `promote` and
`Depth` are fully retired. Packaging is release-ready (real wheel
re-verified installable in a clean venv after Phase 38's dependency-pin
change; `version` is `1.0.0.dev0` as of Phase 39) but **nothing is
published to PyPI and no tag has been cut — and won't be until the
redefined v1, Phase 67 (gate G2-b).**
`README.md` now documents real setup requirements (Python version, `git`,
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`) and a plain free-vs-paid AI enrichment explainer; a new
`ai-docs/` folder gives an agent a capability/boundary overview distinct
from root `CLAUDE.md`'s process rules; a new maintainer-only
`scripts/check_user_docs.py` + `.claude/skills/docs-sync/` mechanically
flags future drift between this repo's own docs and its own code (not
shipped, not a `codecompass` feature). `pyproject.toml`'s 4 runtime
dependencies now carry lower-bound version pins (`decisions/0047`), and
`cli.py`'s query-command boilerplate/`vendor.toml`'s dead `depth` lines
were cleaned up (Phase 38).

## What was just completed

**Phase 40, done** (2026-09-09) — agent-led development model operational.
Gate G4 approved ("Proceed"): `CLAUDE.md` gained §8 (agent-led model),
a §1 paragraph, a §5 DoD amendment (candidate-learning triage +
independent `release-phase-auditor` pass + `context-evaluator` report for
reference-project phases), a §6 milestone bullet — all mirrored into
`CONTRIBUTING.md`. Created `.claude/agents/` (7 definitions, each with
read/write boundaries and independence rules) and
`planning/agent-led-workflow.md` (12-step procedure + trivial-change fast
path). One forced fix: `check_user_docs.py`'s phase-count rule excluded
the redefined-v1 ROADMAP section (Stage A–F phases are process, not
product) + regression test; `README.md` back to "phases 0-38"; captured
as L-001. Live agent smoke delegation deferred to Phase 41's first real
use rather than spawned speculatively. Verified: `ruff` clean;
`check_user_docs.py --strict` clean; `pytest` (full suite — see commit).

**Phase 39, done** (2026-09-09) — ratified the v1 redefinition.
`decisions/0048` (redefined v1 = product-validation milestone, not
packaging) and `decisions/0049` (agent-led development model) written and
`Accepted`. `pyproject.toml` `version` `1.0.0` → `1.0.0.dev0` (gate G1).
Gate G2 → **G2-b**: all publishing held until the redefined-v1 release
(Phase 67, first-ever publish, as `1.0.0`). `planning/ROADMAP.md`: the
Stage A–F section ratified; a reframing note added above the dated
"v1.0 scope notes" (left unedited — historical records); Phase 23 row →
"Part A done; Part B superseded"; Phases 24/25 → `deferred` (not
renumbered); `deferred`/`superseded` added to the status legend.
`README.md` Status section reframed. Verified: `pytest` 520 passed /
1 skipped, `ruff` clean, `check_user_docs.py --strict` clean, no `src/`
change, `git tag -l` still empty. `CLAUDE.md` untouched (its changes are
gate G4, Phases 40–42).

**Redefined-v1 planning session** (2026-09-09) — no code, no governance
change. Inspected the full repo, the release/version state (nothing
published; no tags; `v0.1`/`v0.2` never cut; `pyproject.toml` was at
`1.0.0` via Phase 23 Part A), and both proposed reference projects
(`technical-clipper` — TypeScript MV3 extension, **0 runtime deps**, ~7
build-only devDeps; `ledgerkit` — pure Python, **0 runtime deps**, real
context is the `hledger` executable + manuals + journal syntax). Key
finding: CodeCompass's package-source model produces near-empty output for
both real targets, so the current "publish the package tool = v1.0"
definition is a packaging milestone, not a validated-value milestone.

Produced [`planning/v1-redefinition/`](v1-redefinition/): README (overview
+ versioning assessment + risk analysis + human-decision gates), roadmap
(Stages A–F, phases 39–67, each labelled committed/experimental/
conditional), agent-led-development, learning-lifecycle,
documentation-lifecycle, reference-project-protocol, context-quality-
evaluation, ledgerkit-plan, conditional-generalisation, migration,
proposed-governance-changes (a proposed `CLAUDE.md` §8/§5/§1 diff + ADR
drafts 0048/0049 — NOT applied). Plus the `planning/learnings/` scaffold
(README, inbox, TEMPLATE, promoted log) and Stage A phase plans
(`phase-39` … `phase-43`, `phase-44`). `ROADMAP.md` got an additive
"Redefined CodeCompass v1" section.

**Everything below describes Phase 38 and the foundation (phases 0-38),
still accurate.**

**Phase 38, done** — a final-polish pass requested directly by the user
ahead of finishing Phase 23 Part B. Two research passes ran first: a full
roadmap/state review (confirmed the picture above; also caught that an
initial "README status line is stale" claim from that review was itself
wrong — re-checked directly against the real file, already accurate,
dropped), then a targeted 5-category redundancy/dead-code audit (dead
references to retired `Depth`/`promote`/`grounded_description`, duplicate
logic, unused/unpinned dependencies, doc staleness, test-suite overlap).
Three categories were clean; two had real findings, acted on:
- `cli.py`: extracted `_not_found_error()` (was duplicated verbatim across
  `query_vendor`/`query_relations`) and `_graph_session()`, a context
  manager collapsing the open/`if None: return`/try/finally scaffold that
  6 query commands each hand-repeated.
- `vendor.toml`: stripped 4 dead `depth = "surface"` lines (the retired
  `Depth` field, confirmed never read by `config.py`).
- `pyproject.toml`: added lower-bound pins to all 4 runtime dependencies
  (per user decision, over leaving them unpinned) — `decisions/0047`.
  Verified live, not just assumed: the fresh-venv smoke test resolved
  `anthropic` to a real `1.0.0`, a genuine breaking major version
  (`vendor/anthropic/src/MIGRATION.md`); checked all three of
  codecompass's own `_call_anthropic` implementations line-by-line against
  it — none touch any removed/changed API, so the pin is confirmed safe,
  not just SemVer-optimistic.
The word-boundary mention-regex duplication across `doc_mapping.py`/
`skill_scan.py`/`relation_enrichment.py` was investigated and deliberately
left alone — `decisions/0038` already documents this project's preference
for small, single-purpose modules over shared abstractions here.

Verified: `pytest` 520 passed, 1 skipped (Cargo, no toolchain — unchanged,
pre-existing). `ruff check .` clean. Manual smoke tests: `query vendor`/
`query relations` with a bad name still error identically; `query vendors`/
`query symbol` still work; `codecompass check` against this repo itself
runs clean post-`vendor.toml` edit; `python -m build` + fresh-venv install
+ `codecompass --help` re-verified after the pin change. `python scripts/
check_user_docs.py --strict` caught `README.md`'s phase count still
reading "0-37" once ROADMAP's phase-38 row landed — same catch category
Phase 37 hit — fixed inline, re-ran clean. Committed as `feat(phase-38)`
and pushed to `origin/main`.

**Phases 35-36, done** — requested directly by the user (not found via
`/discovery`), added to v1.0's blocking scope alongside the already-`done`
30-33 group. Full detail for phases 20-34 lives in `CHANGELOG.md` and git
history (per this file's own header — the log of how the project got here
isn't repeated here indefinitely).

- **35**: `README.md` restructured with a real **Setup** section (Python
  `>=3.11`, `git` required locally for vendor cloning, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
  as the optional env var gating Phase B — all previously undocumented) and
  a standalone **"AI enrichment vs. no-AI usage"** section reusing
  `examples/README.md`'s real `--budget 0` transcript rather than a
  fabricated example. New `ai-docs/README.md` (capability/boundary overview
  for an agent, each "does NOT do" claim traced directly to the ADR text
  backing it — `decisions/0026`, `0031`, `0038`, `0040`, `0045` — plus 6
  example prompts) and `ai-docs/CLAUDE.md` (a short entrypoint, explicitly
  not a duplicate of root `CLAUDE.md`'s process rules). `CONTRIBUTING.md`'s
  stale "package has real modules" closing line removed.
- **36**: new maintainer-only `scripts/check_user_docs.py` (outside
  `src/codecompass/`, not a shipped feature — confirmed by the user this
  stays local tooling, never a `codecompass` subcommand) mechanically
  checks five things: every CLI command is mentioned in `docs/
  cli-reference.md`; `README.md`'s "phases 0-N" claim matches the highest
  `done` phase in `planning/ROADMAP.md`; `README.md` mentions
  `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`; every `VendorConfig` field is mentioned in `docs/
  config-schema.md`; every file under `ai-docs/` exists and is non-empty.
  Report-only by default, `--strict` for an exit-code gate; never edits a
  file or calls AI — same mechanical-detection-only posture as `sync.py`/
  `doc_mapping.py`. New `.claude/skills/docs-sync/SKILL.md` instructs an
  agent to run it and apply fixes by judgment, never mechanically.

Verified: `pytest` 505→519 passed (1 skipped, unrelated — the Cargo smoke
test, no toolchain available), all 14 new tests for `check_user_docs.py`
covering every rule's positive/negative path plus `--strict`'s exit code
both ways. `ruff check .` clean. **Confirmed live**: `python scripts/
check_user_docs.py --strict` against this repo's real current state
reports zero findings and exits 0.

Both commits pushed... no — committed locally as `docs(phase-35)` and
`feat(phase-36)`, not yet pushed as of this update (see Next concrete step).
A whole-project `codecompass sync` was then run against this repo itself
(dogfooding): `--budget 0` first (Phase A only, confirmed the new README
Setup/AI-usage sections are already mechanically traced — `query relations
README.md` shows a new "Setup" heading linked to real `anthropic` usage
sites), then, at explicit user go-ahead, `--yes` for real — spent ~$0.02 to
AI-summarize 2 new relationships (`README.md` → the tool Skill, and →
`anthropic`'s new Setup mention), both spot-checked as accurately grounded.

**Phase 37, done** (a third small fix, found via this same dogfooding sync,
not originally planned): `spec_docs._DEFAULT_GLOBS` had no entry for
`ai-docs/`, so `query relations ai-docs/README.md` errored "not found in
context-graph.db" — neither new Phase 35 file was detected as a spec doc at
all. Fixed by adding `"ai-docs/**/*.md"` to the glob set (one line) plus a
regression test. `pytest tests/test_spec_docs.py` — 10 passed. `ruff check .`
clean. **Confirmed live**: re-synced after the fix; both `ai-docs/README.md`
and `ai-docs/CLAUDE.md` now resolve in `query relations` (5 new mechanical
relationships found, not yet AI-enriched — see Next concrete step).

## Next concrete step

**Phase 41** ([`phase-41-learning-lifecycle.md`](phase-41-learning-lifecycle.md))
— make `planning/learnings/` operational: finalise the `knowledge-curator`
brief against the real files, extend `scripts/check_user_docs.py` with
learnings-hygiene checks (+ tests), and run L-001 through the full
promote/retain/merge/discard triage end-to-end as the first real exercise
of the agent-led loop (its DoD already requires a `release-phase-auditor`
pass). No human-decision gate blocks it. ADR `0050` only if a non-obvious
curation tradeoff surfaces.

This is also the point to run a **live agent smoke delegation** (deferred
from Phase 40): dispatching `knowledge-curator` for the L-001 triage and
`release-phase-auditor` for the DoD check validates the roster's
frontmatter/tooling for real.

Open items carried from the foundation:

1. **The first-ever publish is Phase 67** (redefined v1, `1.0.0`) — gate
   G2-b holds everything until then. No `twine`, no git tag during Stages
   A–F.
2. **A one-line pointer from root `CLAUDE.md` to `ai-docs/README.md`** —
   still not done; a candidate target change for **Phase 43** (the
   agent-led dogfood run — doubles as a live test of the `CLAUDE.md` §0
   approval flow through an agent-led phase).
3. **Phase 37's fix surfaced 5 new mechanical relationships for
   `ai-docs/README.md`/`ai-docs/CLAUDE.md`** — still "mentioned, not yet
   enriched"; also a Phase 43 candidate target change.

The former open question of whether routing/rollup and MCP (24/25) should
be deferred is now settled: `decisions/0048` marks 24 a Stage C candidate
(conditional on reference-project evidence) and 25 post-redefined-v1, not
renumbered.

**Still outstanding, not a blocker but worth remembering:**
- Once a Rust toolchain is available anywhere in the pipeline,
  `decisions/0014` requires validating the Cargo adapter against real
  `cargo metadata` output and a real crate — currently entirely
  unverified.
- `extract_npm_symbols` (Phase 3) is untested against real-world `.d.ts`
  authoring styles beyond hand-written fixtures.
- `chat.py` has still never been run against the real Anthropic API in
  this environment.
- `staleness.py`'s version parser has no real PEP 440/semver correctness.
- A formal trigger-accuracy evaluation harness for per-vendor Skills
  (`decisions/0013`) remains outstanding.
- Cursor `.mdc` export has no `globs` field — documented future
  refinement, not implemented.
- `doc_chunks`' per-chunk `content_hash` (Phase 32) isn't yet consumed
  for cache-invalidation grain — `select_candidates` still hashes a
  relation's *full* source-doc text against the target's text, unchanged
  since Phase 22. Computed correctly and available for a future phase if
  chunk-grain cache invalidation is ever pursued (noted in
  `decisions/0046`), not wired up now.
- The fenced-code-block fix (Phase 34) only tracks ` ``` `/`~~~` fences,
  not indented (4-space) code blocks — not a gap in practice, since a
  heading regex requires `#` at column 0, which an indented block's
  content can never satisfy.
- `vendor/` exists in this checkout with real, enriched content — a live
  artifact of past validation runs, not a fixture. Still gitignored and
  freely regeneratable (`decisions/0010`).
- A local `.venv/` exists at the project root (gitignored) with
  `codecompass` installed editable, for local testing.
